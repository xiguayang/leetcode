what is the property of BST:
1. For every node in BST, every node's value in its left sub tree is less than val of the node,
    and every node's value in its right sub tree is larger than the val of the node
2. For every node, its left sub tree and right sub tree are both BST
***IMPORTANT****:
3. The values from traversal of inorder(LDR) are increasing.
    BST 的中序遍历结果是有序的（升序）。
    void traverse(TreeNode root){
        if(root==null) return;

        traverse(root.left);
        /******inorder*****/
        traverse(root.right);
    }

4. BST 增删查改都可以是O(LogN)的复杂度
